Dr. Jeremy Price is Assistant Professor of Technology, Innovation, and Pedagogy in Urban Education and serves as the Primary Investigator and Project Director for the Digital Education Hub for Rigorous Remote Learning with Communities (DEH) and the National Antisemitism in Schools Study (NASISS). As a **public scholar-advocate**, I am invested in using my experiences and expertise to engage and build capacity and capital for marginalized and minoritized youth and community to build, strengthen, and sustain an inclusive and just democratic project. I delineate my nested goals in Figure 1 which focus primarily on two stances:

 * fostering community-engaged educational systems with technology and
 * disrupting and dismantling the threats of white nationalism and white supremacy in educational systems.
